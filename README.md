# allitebooks-scraper
You can use this script to download all books from allitebooks.com, you can choose to download all books in pdf or just extract
all download links with information related to book (author, date created etc).
If you want to download all books in pdf, set the download_books variable in script to True, otherwise let it be False, that 
will save all the download links of all books with all information related to that book in a text file.

**You only need to install two external python libraries for this script to work properly:**

- requests
install requests by running pip install requests
- beautifulsoup
install beautifulsoup by running pip install beautifulsoup4
